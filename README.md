# ikea-product-availability
For some special order items, IKEA doesn't have an option to notify you by email when items are back in stock. This app can be deployed on Heroku and scheduled using [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler). A notification text is sent when items are back in stock.
